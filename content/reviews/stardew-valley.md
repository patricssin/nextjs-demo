Functional and non-functional requirements must not only be applied in the Backend but also in the Frontend. Thus, with Frontend Architecture we are able to fulfill the business requirements.

However, in my opinion, the most valuable reason for Frontend Architecture is the maintainability and scalability of any project.s
